# Architecture

Welcome to the architecture overview of our Intelligent Document Management System (DMS)! In this document, we'll delve into the underlying design principles and technological components that power our innovative DMS.

## Overview

Our DMS architecture is built upon a blend of modern architectural patterns, including **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)**, **Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS)**, **hexagonal architecture**, and **Domain Events**. These patterns collectively enable us to create a scalable, maintainable, and extensible system that meets the evolving needs of document management.

## Core Components

### Domain-Driven Design (DDD)

At the heart of our architecture is **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)**, emphasizing the importance of modeling the problem domain and its entities as the primary focus of software design. By defining clear boundaries around domain concepts and behaviors, we ensure that our system remains aligned with the real-world domain it serves.

### Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS)

**CQRS** separates the responsibility of handling commands (write operations) from queries (read operations), enabling us to optimize each path independently. This separation of concerns allows us to design specialized components tailored to their respective tasks, leading to improved performance and flexibility.

### Hexagonal Architecture

**Hexagonal Architecture**, also known as Ports and Adapters, facilitates the decoupling of core application logic from external dependencies such as databases, frameworks, and UIs. By defining clear interfaces (ports) for interaction with the application core, we enable seamless integration of various adapters, ensuring that our system remains adaptable to change.

### Domain Events

**Domain Events** provide a mechanism for capturing significant state changes within the domain and broadcasting them to interested parties. By leveraging Domain Events, we enable loose coupling between domain entities, allowing them to react to changes asynchronously while preserving consistency and coherence across the system.

## Integration with AI Technologies

Our DMS integrates seamlessly with advanced AI technologies to enhance its capabilities and provide users with intelligent document management solutions. Leveraging **Language Model-based Systems (LLMs)**, such as OpenAI's **GPT-3**, our system empowers users to interact with the document repository conversationally, enabling natural language queries and interactions.

## Code Architecture

Our code architecture follows a layered approach, ensuring a clear separation of concerns and promoting maintainability and scalability. The system is divided into the following layers:

### Presentation Layer

The **presentation layer** is responsible for interacting with the outside world, handling user inputs, and presenting outputs to users. This layer contains all user interfaces, controllers, and presentation-related logic. It acts as the entry point for user interactions and delegates requests to the appropriate layers for processing.

### Application Layer

The **application layer** houses the business logic of the system, including checks, validations, and orchestrations of use cases. Here, business rules are enforced, and the overall flow of the application is controlled. This layer acts as an intermediary between the presentation layer and the domain layer, ensuring that business logic remains isolated and reusable.

### Domain Layer

The **domain layer** encapsulates the core domain logic of the application, including domain objects, aggregates, entities, and domain events. It represents the real-world concepts and behaviors relevant to the problem domain. Domain objects encapsulate both data and behavior, enforcing business rules and ensuring consistency and integrity of the domain model. This layer is independent of any specific infrastructure or application logic, making it highly portable and reusable.

### Infrastructure Layer

The **infrastructure layer** is responsible for interacting with external systems, such as databases, external APIs, and third-party services. It provides implementations for data access, external integrations, and infrastructure-related concerns. This layer abstracts away the details of external dependencies, allowing the rest of the system to remain agnostic to specific implementation details. It also includes infrastructure-related cross-cutting concerns, such as logging, caching, and security.

By adhering to this layered architecture, we ensure that our system remains modular, maintainable, and testable. Each layer has well-defined responsibilities and dependencies, making it easier to understand, extend, and evolve the system over time.
